## RIG scores together with (rescaled) sequence Entropy

This directory will contain the plots generated by the [xxx.py](../../scripts/xxx.py) 
script.

As an example, the RIG plot with together with (rescaled) sequence Entropy of the RF02230 Rfam family is reported. The RIG 
scores are calculated using RNA Blocks obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 90% of similarity. The 
sequence Entropy is rescaled in a way similar to RIG in order to compare them in a more intuitive way.

In the lower part there is a colour mapping representing the consensus structure of the family. In this case the stem 
towards the 3â€™ end is more conserved in structure than it is in sequence throughout the family members.
