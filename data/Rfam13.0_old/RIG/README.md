## Relative Information Gain (RIG) scores

This folder contains the RIG scores calculated using [RNA Blocks](../../../outputs/RNA_Blocks) obtained by 
removing redundant primary sequences up to 50% and up to 90% of similarity for each Rfam seed alignment.

In particular,
- the [nogaps](nogaps) folder contains the RIG scores, without the gap positions in the alignments;
- the [nogaps](withgaps) folder contains the RIG scores, including the gap positions in the alignments.
