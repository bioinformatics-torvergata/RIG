## Structural Position Specific Scoring Matrix (sPSSM)

This folder will contain the plots generated by the [make_PSSM.py](../../scripts/make_PSSM.py) script.

As an example, if it is specified `Zbear_62` as Matrix of Bear encoded RNA (MBR) version, `MBR_Zbear_62.tsv ` as MBR, 
and `Zbear.tsv` as alphabet, the script outputs are two pickle files:

- the `rfam_PSSM_Zbear_62.pickle`, with the sPSSM in array form;
- the `rfam_PSSM_dic_Zbear_62.pickle`, with the sPSSM in dictionary form.
