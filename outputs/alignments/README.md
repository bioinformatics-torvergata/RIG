## BEAR alignment

The folder contains the structural alignments for each Rfam family. The structural alignment are expressed with different
[encodings](../alphabets), and obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 50% and up to 90% of similarity for each
Rfam seed alignment.

In particular, the folder:

- [bear_new_alignment_bear_50](bear_new_alignment_bear_50) contains the structural alignment expressed with the [BEAR
encoding](../alphabets/bear.tsv), and obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 50% of similarity for each
Rfam seed alignment.
- [bear_new_alignment_bear_62](bear_new_alignment_bear_62) contains the structural alignment expressed with the [BEAR
encoding](../alphabets/bear.tsv), and obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 62% of similarity for each
Rfam seed alignment.
- [bear_new_alignment_bear_90](bear_new_alignment_bear_90) contains the structural alignment expressed with the [BEAR
encoding](../alphabets/bear.tsv), and obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 90% of similarity for each
Rfam seed alignment.


- [bear_new_alignment_qbear_50](bear_new_alignment_qbear_50) contains the structural alignment expressed with the [qBEAR
encoding](../alphabets/qbear.tsv), and obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 50% of similarity for each
Rfam seed alignment.
- [bear_new_alignment_qbear_62](bear_new_alignment_qbear_62) contains the structural alignment expressed with the [qBEAR
encoding](../alphabets/qbear.tsv), and obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 62% of similarity for each
Rfam seed alignment.
- [bear_new_alignment_qbear_90](bear_new_alignment_qbear_90) contains the structural alignment expressed with the [qBEAR
encoding](../alphabets/qbear.tsv), and obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 90% of similarity for each
Rfam seed alignment.


- [bear_new_alignment_zbear_50](bear_new_alignment_zbear_50) contains the structural alignment expressed with the [qBEAR
encoding](../alphabets/zbear.tsv), and obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 50% of similarity for each
Rfam seed alignment.
- [bear_new_alignment_zbear_62](bear_new_alignment_zbear_62) contains the structural alignment expressed with the [qBEAR
encoding](../alphabets/zbear.tsv), and obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 62% of similarity for each
Rfam seed alignment.
- [bear_new_alignment_zbear_90](bear_new_alignment_zbear_90) contains the structural alignment expressed with the [qBEAR
encoding](../alphabets/zbear.tsv), and obtained by removing redundant primary sequences up to 90% of similarity for each
Rfam seed alignment.
