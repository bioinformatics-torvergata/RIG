## Matrix of Bear encoded RNA (MBR)

This folder will contain the plots generated by the [make_MBR.py](../../scripts/make_MBR.py) script.

As an example, if it is specified `50` as identity threshold, and `qbear` as alphabet, and `qbear50_info` as information 
output file, the script outputs are:

- the `substitution_qbear_50.tsv` matrix with the observed substitutions;
- the `q_ij_qbear_50.tsv` matrix with the observed relative frequencies;
- the `E_ij_qbear_50.tsv` matrix with the expected relative frequencies by chance;
- the `odds_ratio_matrix_qbear_50.tsv` matrix representing the odds ratio between the observed frequencies and the 
expected frequency by chance;
- the `MBR_qbear_50.tsv` file, which contains the generated MBR;
- the `matrix_qbear_50.pdf` heatmap showing the generated MBR.
- the `qbear50_info` file containing the `Expected Score` and the `Entropy`. TODO EXPLAIN
