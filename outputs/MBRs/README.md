## Matrix of Bear encoded RNA (MBR)

This folder will contain the plots generated by the [make_MBR.py](../../scripts/make_MBR.py) script.

As an example, if `50` is the identity threshold, `qbear.tsv` the alphabet, and `qbear50_info` the information 
output file, the script outputs will be in the `zbear_90` sub-folder, which will contain:

- the `odds_ratio_matrix_qbear_50.tsv` matrix representing the odds ratio between the observed frequencies and the 
expected frequency by chance;
- the `MBR_qbear_50.tsv` file, which contains the generated MBR;
- the `matrix_qbear_50.pdf` heatmap showing the generated MBR.
- the `qbear50_info` file containing the `Expected Score` and the `Entropy`.
